# binary_search
A comparison of iterative and recursive Binary Search in C++, including complexity analysis and findings.
# Binary Search: Iterative vs. Recursive Approach in C++

## **Overview**  
This project implements **Binary Search** using:  
1. **Iterative Approach** üîÑ  
2. **Recursive Approach** üîÅ  

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on **sorted arrays** by dividing the search space in half at each step.  

---

## **How to Run the Code**  

### **1. Compile the Code**  
Use a C++ compiler like **g++**:  
```sh
g++ binary_search.cpp -o binary_search
2. Run the Program
sh

./binary_search
3. Expected Output
The program will prompt for an array and a target value.

It will search for the value using both iterative and recursive methods.

It will print whether the value is found and its index.
